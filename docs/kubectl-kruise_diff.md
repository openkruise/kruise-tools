## kubectl-kruise diff

Diff the live version against a would-be applied version

### Synopsis

Diff configurations specified by file name or stdin between the current online configuration, and the configuration as it would be if applied.

 The output is always YAML.

 KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable can be used to select your own diff command. Users can use external commands with params too, example: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="colordiff -N -u"

 By default, the "diff" command available in your path will be run with the "-u" (unified diff) and "-N" (treat absent files as empty) options.

 Exit status: 0 No differences were found. 1 Differences were found. >1 Kubectl or diff failed with an error.

 Note: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF, if used, is expected to follow that convention.

```
kubectl-kruise diff -f FILENAME
```

### Examples

```
  # Diff resources included in pod.json
  kubectl diff -f pod.json
  
  # Diff file read from stdin
  cat service.yaml | kubectl diff -f -
```

### Options

```
      --field-manager string          Name of the manager used to track field ownership. (default "kubectl-client-side-apply")
  -f, --filename strings              Filename, directory, or URL to files contains the configuration to diff
      --force-conflicts               If true, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts.
  -h, --help                          help for diff
  -k, --kustomize string              Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
      --prune                         Include resources that would be deleted by pruning. Can be used with -l and default shows all resources would be pruned
      --prune-allowlist stringArray   Overwrite the default whitelist with <group/version/kind> for --prune
  -R, --recursive                     Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
  -l, --selector string               Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2). Matching objects must satisfy all of the specified label constraints.
      --server-side                   If true, apply runs in the server instead of the client.
```
