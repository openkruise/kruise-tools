name: kubectl-kruise set resources
synopsis: |
    Update resource requests/limits on objects with pod templates
description: |-
    Specify compute resource requirements (cpu, memory) for any resource that defines a pod template.  If a pod is successfully scheduled, it is guaranteed the amount of resource requested, but may burst up to its specified limits.

     for each compute resource, if a limit is specified and a request is omitted, the request will default to the limit.

     Possible resources include (case insensitive):

            pod (po), deployment (deploy), statefulset (sts), daemonset (ds), replicaset (rs), cloneset (clone), statefulset.apps.kruise.io (asts), daemonset.apps.kruise.io (ads)
usage: kubectl-kruise set resources (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME)  ([--limits=LIMITS & --requests=REQUESTS]
options:
    - name: all
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Select all resources, including uninitialized ones, in the namespace of the specified resource types
    - name: allow-missing-template-keys
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.

      default_value: none
      usage: |
        Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
    - name: filename

      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to get from a server.

      usage: |
        The resource requirement requests for this container.  For example, 'cpu=100m,memory=256Mi'.  Note that server side components may assign requests depending on the server configuration, such as limit ranges.
    - name: local
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, set resources will NOT contact api-server but run locally.

        Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
    - name: recursive
      shorthand: R
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
    - name: requests
      usage: |
        The resource requirement requests for this container.  For example, 'cpu=100m,memory=256Mi'.  Note that server side components may assign requests depending on the server configuration, such as limit ranges.
    - name: selector
      shorthand: l
      usage: |
        Selector (label query) to filter on, not including uninitialized ones,supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
    - name: show-managed-fields
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
    - name: template
      usage: |
        Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
