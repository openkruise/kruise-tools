name: kubectl-kruise set selector
synopsis: Set the selector on a resource
description: |-
    Set the selector on a resource. Note that the new selector will overwrite the old selector if the resource had one prior to the invocation of 'set selector'.

     A selector must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up to  63 characters. If --resource-version is specified, then updates will use this resource version, otherwise the existing resource-version will be used. Note: currently selectors can only be set on Service objects.
usage: kubectl-kruise set selector (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME) EXPRESSIONS [--resource-version=version]
