name: kubectl-kruise expose
synopsis: |
    Take a workload(e.g. deployment, cloneset), service or pod and expose it as a new Kubernetes Service
description: |-
    Expose a resource as a new Kubernetes service.

     Looks up a deployment, service, replica set, replication controller or pod by name and uses the selector for that resource as the selector for a new service on the specified port. A deployment or replica set will be exposed as a service only if its selector is convertible to a selector that service supports, i.e. when the selector contains only the matchLabels component. Note that if no port is specified via --port and the exposed resource has multiple ports, all will be re-used by the new service. Also if no labels are specified, the new service will re-use the labels from the resource it exposes.

     Possible resources include (case insensitive):

     pod (po), service (svc), replicationcontroller (rc), cloneset (clone), deployment (deploy), replicaset (rs)
usage: kubectl-kruise expose (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME) [--port=port] [--protocol=TCP|UDP|SCTP] [--target-port=number-or-name] [--name=name] [--external-ip=external-ip-of-service] [--type=type]
options:
    - name: allow-missing-template-keys
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
    - name: cluster-ip
      usage: |
        ClusterIP to be assigned to the service. Leave empty to auto-allocate, or set to 'None' to create a headless service.
    - name: container-port

    - name: dry-run
      default_value: none
      usage: |
        Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
    - name: external-ip
      usage: |
        Additional external IP address (not managed by Kubernetes) to accept for the service. If this IP is routed to a node, the service can be accessed by this IP in addition to its generated service IP.

      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
    - name: recursive
      shorthand: R
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
    - name: save-config
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
    - name: selector
      usage: |
        A label selector to use for this service. Only equality-based selector requirements are supported. If empty (the default) infer the selector from the replication controller or replica set.)
