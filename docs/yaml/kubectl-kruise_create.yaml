      default_value: none
      usage: |

      usage: help for create
    - name: kustomize
      shorthand: k

    - name: output
      shorthand: o
      usage: |
        Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).
    - name: raw
      usage: |
        Raw URI to POST to the server.  Uses the transport specified by the kubeconfig file.
    - name: record
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
    - name: recursive
      shorthand: R
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
    - name: save-config
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
    - name: selector
      shorthand: l
      usage: |
        Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)

      default_value: strict
      usage: |-
        Must be one of: strict (or true), warn, ignore (or false).
        		"true" or "strict" will use a schema to validate the input and fail the request if invalid. It will perform server side validation if ServerSideFieldValidation is enabled on the api-server, but will fall back to less reliable client-side validation if not.
        		"warn" will warn about unknown or duplicate fields without blocking the request if server-side field validation is enabled on the API server, and behave as "ignore" otherwise.
        		"false" or "ignore" will not perform any schema validation, silently dropping any unknown or duplicate fields.
